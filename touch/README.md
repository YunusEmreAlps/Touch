<!-- ABOUT US -->
## About Us

TouchPay was founded on a dream of creating a global consumer technology company from Konya. We started our journey in 2021 with the vision of planting seeds for the future.

Our goal at TouchPay is to gather people with high capabilities, strong values and a will to shape TouchPay’s story. To start realising our big dreams, we choose social network as our first and main area of focus. Social network is one of the few truly universal activities that transcends age, gender or nationality and we believe with the right product, we could reach billions of people worldwide.
